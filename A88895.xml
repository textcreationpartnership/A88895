         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When <hi>I</hi> came to <hi>Yorke I</hi> told the King that <hi>I</hi> was come thither to receive his Maieſties Commandments and Inſtructions for that imployment: which he had done me the honour to confer upon me, and <hi>I</hi> did humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him that <hi>I</hi> might not be ſtayed at Court becauſe the Parliament did deſire my ſpeedy repair into <hi>Jreland,</hi> and that this ſervice as <hi>I</hi> conceived did require it at leaſt that ſome governour (if I were not thought worthy of it) ſhould be preſently ſent into that Kingdome; the King told me he would thinke of it; but I muſt confeſſe <hi>I</hi> did not find his Majeſty ſo ready to diſpatch me as <hi>I</hi> hoped and expected. From that time <hi>I</hi> did not faile to beſeech his Maieſty to ſend me away, upon every opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity I had of ſpeaking to him, and <hi>I</hi> thinke there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not a day, that I did not deſire the Secretaries of State and ſome other perſons about the King, to put his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty in mind of me, and to haſten my diſmiſſion: and diverſe times I made it my Petition to the King, that he would diſpatch me, or declare his intention that hee would not let me goe at all.</p>
            <p>The King ſaid my inſtructions ſhould be drawn, and that he would give Order to Maſter Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> to doe it as ſpeedily as he could, in expectation whereof, I ſtayed about three weekes, till the King came from <hi>Yorke,</hi> when his Majeſty appoynted me to follow him to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and there I ſhould have my expeditions, I obey'd his Maj. and came after him to this Town, where
<pb facs="tcp:156121:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 43 -->I have attended ever ſince, perpetually ſoliciting to bee diſpatched, and beſeeching his Majeſty that I might either goe to my imployment, or have his leave to retire my ſelfe to my owne houſe and private condition, that if he were unwilling to truſt me in an imployment of ſo great importance, I did beſeech him that I might be no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to his thoughts, and that he would be ſo gracious as to let me know his reſolution, for I conceived my ſelf to be under a heavy cenſure, both of the Parliament and of the whole Kingdome, whilſt poſsibly they might thinke it my fault that I was ſo long abſent from that charge which I had undertaken. It is to no purpoſe to tell you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very paſſage, but this I profeſſe to your Lordſhip, that if it bad beene to ſave the lives of all my Friends, and of my ſelfe, I could not have done more for my diſpatch, nevertheleſſe I have not beene able to advance it one ſtep, nor have I ſeene any token to make me hope to have it quickly till this morning, when Maſter Secretary <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> gave me a draught of my inſtructions to peruſe, and ſo <hi>I</hi> hope that betweene this and monday I ſhall have done that part, and <hi>I</hi> will doe the beſt <hi>I</hi> can in procuring ſome other things, without which <hi>I</hi> know not how <hi>I</hi> ſhall be able to doe any acceptable ſervice in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; your Lordſhip knowes <hi>I</hi> am a ſervant, and <hi>I</hi> could not run away if <hi>I</hi> would, or at leaſt it had beene to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe though <hi>I</hi> ſhould have adventured to doe ſo undecent and ſo undutifull an action.
